make sure we have the thumb+large sizes of all /my/pic/digicam jpgs
ready for serving. Photo site can make its own if any are missing, but
that will be slower.

this should be run after new photos are imported, and maybe every
night to catch strays.

it would be faster to make the 75px images out of the 600px images.
